% function [fcoefs]=MakeERBFilters(fs,numChannels,lowFreq,order)
% This function computes the filter coefficients for a bank of 
% Gammatone filters.  These filters were defined by Patterson and 
% Holdworth for simulating the cochlea.  
% 
% The result is returned as an array of filter coefficients.  Each row 
% of the filter arrays contains the coefficients for four second order 
% filters.  The transfer function for these four filters share the same
% denominator (poles) but have different numerators (zeros).  All of these
% coefficients are assembled into one vector that the ERBFilterBank 
% can take apart to implement the filter.
%
% The filter bank contains "numChannels" channels that extend from
% half the sampling rate (fs) to "lowFreq".  Alternatively, if the numChannels
% input argument is a vector, then the values of this vector are taken to
% be the center frequency of each desired filter.  (The lowFreq argument is
% ignored in this case.)

% Note this implementation fixes a problem in the original code by
% computing four separate second order filters.  This avoids a big
% problem with round off errors in cases of very small cfs (100Hz) and
% large sample rates (44kHz).  The problem is caused by roundoff error
% when a number of poles are combined, all very close to the unit
% circle.  Small errors in the eigth order coefficient, are multiplied
% when the eigth root is taken to give the pole location.  These small
% errors lead to poles outside the unit circle and instability.  Thanks
% to Julius Smith for leading me to the proper explanation.

% Execute the following code to evaluate the frequency
% response of a 10 channel filterbank.
%	fcoefs = MakeERBFilters(16000,10,100);
%	y = ERBFilterBank([1 zeros(1,511)], fcoefs);
%	resp = 20*log10(abs(fft(y')));
%	freqScale = (0:511)/512*16000;
%	semilogx(freqScale(1:255),resp(1:255,:));
%	axis([100 16000 -60 0])
%	xlabel('Frequency (Hz)'); ylabel('Filter Response (dB)');
